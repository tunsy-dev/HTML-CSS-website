            1.1	Describing the content and layout for each page
            </h3>
            <p>
            The website consists of six pages. A Landing page, Index page, Unit one, Unit two, About and Contact page. The landing page is simple with just my name on it. I wanted this page to be subtle but eye catching. The index page is the next page. This page is again very simple, the aim for this page was for it to have one purpose. To direct the user to either unit one or two of the coursework. To achieve this the page appears split in two consisting of two styled links covering the whole page. If you click on the left it takes you too unit one and if you click on the right you get directed to unit two. The layout for unit one has a title at the top so that you know that is the page you are viewing it then has in three stylised boxes links to outcome one, outcome two and outcome three. These links take you to the position on the page that corresponds to each of them.  Each section has its own nav bar so that you can quickly navigate to each question in that section. At the bottom of the page is two large links styled similar to the ones at the top that can direct either back to the top of the page or to the page with unit two on it. The page with unit two is styled to match unit one, however as there was only one outcome section it has only one section on it. The About page has information about me on, the page is made to fit in with the same theme as the rest of the website and is kept simple. The contact page is designed the same as the about me page but with details of how to contact me on it.

            1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.
            </h3>
            <p>
            Copyright is “the exclusive legal right to reproduce, publish, sell, or distribute the matter and form of something.”[1]. Copyright laws protect creative and intellectual property from those who would steal it. From the moment of creation, the right to a creative work exists. There is no need for the work to be published or registered. In web design, copyright laws protect the unique aspects of a site. Such as images, videos, text, and the underlying code. On a website, the copyright notice prohibits others from duplicating images text or other creative elements on a site as well as the source code. However, it does not prevent a web designer from recreating a look at a site if they're using their own original source code [2]. You are allowed to use other websites for inspiration but you cannot copy specific elements or the code. If you want to copy a website you can do this legally if you ask the website owner for permission. [2].
            The website can be particularly susceptible to theft of content and copyright violations. A website can have elements accessed randomly downloaded as chucks and disturbed out of context. For this reason, it is important to try and include a copyright notice on as many induvial items as possible[3].</p>

            1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.
            </h3>
            <p>
            Access to the web can be affected by certain disabilities. Web accessibility tries to broach these aims for websites, tools, and technologies that are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them [1]. It is important that the web be accessible to as many people as possible in order to provide equal access to people with diverse abilities [1].
            Some ways in which we can make our websites more accessible. It can be through a variation of perceivable information and user interface, an example of this would be to enable different layouts and color schemes so that the page can be viewed clearer by someone who is visually impaired[2]. Operable user interface and navigation are also to be considered, keyboard navigation an example of this not all users of a website may use a mouse, therefore, it is necessary to make the page navigatable through the keyboard and that the user doesn’t lose out on any functionality of the website [2]. It is also important for the content to be as readable as possible and that able to be read out by text to speech clearly [2].

            <h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites.</h3>
            <p>For a website to function as efficiently as possible only certain file types should be used.
            Depending on what the image is the type of file you would want to use varies. Images are either raster or vector file types. Vector images are built using proportional formulas this means that they can be resized without losing any quality. This makes them perfect for logos.[1] however they don’t work well with photographs. Instead, Raster images would be used. These are built through a series of pixels and lose quality if resized [1].
            Popular raster file types are JPG, GIF, and PNG. All of which have their pros and cons and can be used for different purposes.
            JPG benefits from the fact that it takes up very little storage space and is quick to upload or download. It is a very popular choice for images on the internet due to this reason. However, jpg files are lossy, this means that when they are compressed unnecessary data is deleted from the file permanently. This results in some loss of quality in the image. Another drawback to jpg is that they don’t support transparency [2].
            PNG images are lossless meaning they don’t lose any data when compressed. The images are a larger file size. And are used similarly to jpeg images. However, PNG allows for animation and supports transparency.
            SVG files are vector file types. They are lossless like PNG. However, being vector files, the images remain clear at any resolution. This is because SVG files are not drawn from pixels. But instead are created by mathematically declared shapes and curves. The only drawback to SVG is that they are relatively large compared to other file formats [2].</p>
