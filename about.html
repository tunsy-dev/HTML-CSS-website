<div class="about"><p>After graduating from university with a degree in BA/BSc (Hons) Philosophy/ Psychology, I developed a keen interest in coding and quickly discovered that I would rather pursue a career in web development. From here I began looking into what I would need to learn in order to pursue this. I began by teaching myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript using online resources, developing websites as I went in order to put in to practice what I was learning. My passion for coding grow throughout this time and it was clear that I had made the right choice to undergo this challenge. 
    After doing this for a while I found out about Code Nation and enrolled on a course with them. This was an amazing opportunity and it enabled a more directed learning technique and support whilst undertaking this development. Through the course I was able to develop the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Java. Gaining a much more thorough understanding of how these languages work and function. As well as this the course was able to give me a more efficient learning style that I could apply myself after completion.  </p>
