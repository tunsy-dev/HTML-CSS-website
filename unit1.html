        <h3>
            1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.
        </h3>
        <p>
            IT has a vital role in modern business. From communications, advertising, global reach, effective algorithms, machine learning, and more.  Any business that has embraced the innovation of technology will have an advantage in its competitive market than one that has not.  Through IT businesses have access to data, software, and hardware that can drastically increase a business’s productivity and effectiveness in the market. With technology, for example, a shop can now sell products globally instead of in their immediate vicinity, with this increase of potential consumers, there is also an increase in competitors. This results in a high value being put on the online aspect of a business. Online sales can be seen to be a much larger revenue for many businesses [1]. This also results in higher emphasis being put on digital marketing as it can now be seen to be more efficient than newspaper television and radio advertising [2]. Technology has also given companies the ability to use consumer data to target ads and products. Showing just how important IT has become in this aspect of modern business.
            </p>
            <p>
            IT has also massively bolstered the productivity of teams and businesses by providing them with tools through differing software to complete tasks much more effectively than they would have been able to without them. For example, the Software on your computer can check for spelling and grammar mistakes, reducing the time it would take to check a piece of work. And there are now endless amounts of software to help with almost every task you or your business might come across. </p>
            <p>The importance of IT’s role in communication and every aspect of the business has been highlighted during the coronavirus pandemic. Through technology employees and businesses have been able to carry on functioning. Cloud networks have become a much more efficient method to store data and monitor a computer network than a private computer network. They also allow employees access to data and information from anywhere. Meaning that they can share work and carry on collaborating on projects. Software such as zoom and google hangouts has stepped in to replace physical communication. Allowing direct communication between employees and meetings to still happen. </p>
            <p>“IT has continued its relentless march into almost every aspect of organizational life, and as innovation itself has taken on greater importance as a driver of organizational competitiveness.” (Hamel, 1998) [3]. </p>
            <p>A business that has embraced technology in their innovation will be seen to have more accurate business planning, more effective marketing, higher global sales, more systematic management, use real-time monitoring, and offer instant customer support. making them much more competitive in their market [4]. It is clear to see the importance of It in so many aspects of a business. Technologies are developed to make business more efficient in improving productivity and reach. However, with new technologies being developed and the speed of this, it is essential that businesses adapt, make use, and implement new technologies where appropriate. In order to carry on competing in a competitive market if not they can very easily find themselves behind the curve and out of competition. </p>

            <h3>
                1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
            </h3>
            <p>In order to complete a successful digital project. We need to apply various methods, skills, and resources. The accumulation of these should result in achieving the desired goal of the project. Planning and timekeeping are crucial to this. Once a plan is completed it is important that you implement the plan, develop and refine if necessary, so that you are able to complete the task. If you have planned a project well it will turn out well. Timekeeping and planning are a skill. However, there are various methods that we can use to help with this, from Kanban boards to mind maps and lists. Different technologies have made these even easier to use and share. When applied effectively these can boost the efficiency of your workflow tremendously. Enabling you to easily track your works progress and meet all your deadlines. </p>
            <p>It is important that you use the right tools for the project. We used Visual studio code this text editor helps optimize workflow with extensions and dedicated workspaces for projects. Using the right software for what you’re working on could make all the difference in a project for you to reach the desired outcome in the time scale required. </p>
            <p>The skills to develop a clear understanding of a project or a brief set by a client is necessary. It is important to know exactly what a client wants even if this means you have to clarify with them at points. This leads to the importance of communication as a skill. Communication is vital when working on a project in a team. It is essential to be able to communicate clearly, effectively, and efficiently with those you are working with and for. The role of technology in communicating is essential now more than ever. There are numerous programs and software to help us communicate with each other more effectively when working on a project. 
            During the code nation course, we used the program Slack in order to communicate and share information. Software such as Slack allows users to create groups and organize messages into sections, enabling communication on a range of areas to be discussed among different people without them getting muddled together. This means that it can become a hub for employees to communicate with each other.  Google hangouts and zoom, also aided communication, video conferences allow for clear communication, these programs also have the ability to screen share. This makes it possible to discuss and work on projects over the internet rather than having to be in the same building. </p>
            <p>
            Cloud sharing enables us to share and work on documents at the same time over the internet, for example, multiple people could edit a google doc at the same time. Or can be working on a cloud-based text editor software to work on the same bit of code at the same time. And update and share a Kanban board so that everyone knows what there working on at the same time.  All of these skills and resources, when brought together, will reduce risk and result in a successful project. </p>

                1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? include a link to your Trello board.
            </h3>
            <p>IT can help us plan and carry out tasks whilst working on developing a website. It can be used to make age-old techniques much more efficient and easier to implement. In order to plan the website, I will use the Kanban method. I was able to use Trello in order to do this much more effectively as it enables you to create tasks and move them around your Kanban board easily online. The use of Trello is good as you can instantly store your ideas and tasks and see where you are up to in a project and what still needs to be completed. If you were working with multiple people you can also add people to the Trello board and assign tasks so you can keep track of each other’s progress in the project. Trello also allows you to use colour schemes that you could use to assign levels of priority to a task. So, all in all, if you use Trello you should be able to complete all tasks and finish a project. Another tool to plan the project that was used is diagrams. This software provides the tools to easily make a flow chart or a mind map of your ideas so that you can effectively lay your ideas and develop the project efficiently. </p>

            <h3>
               1.4	Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? 
            </h3>
            
            <p>There are multiple risks that might result in a digital project failing. Billions of dollars are wasted each year on failed software projects. IT experts agree that these are often predictable and avoidable software however failure occurs far more often than they should [1]. </p>
            <p>
            So why do so many digital projects fail? 
            <br>
            Often failure can be due to inadequate planning. A Report in 2016 by Innotas found that 55 percent of IT professionals surveyed have had a project fail due to lack of time, staff resources, or budget [2]. There are so many things that can go wrong when it comes to planning a project and many companies often have unrealistic expectations of how long a project will take or cost that results in the project failing [2].  Unclear project requirements can also contribute to a project failing. It could, unfortunately, be that the project brief wasn’t clear enough resulting in developers being unsure of what features are needed in the project. Or the end result of a project if the company intends to take it in a different direction or scale it up after completion [2].  If there is a lack of alignment in a team it is likely to cause a digital project to fail. If there is a lack of communication or understanding across a team tasks will get missed out, deadlines will get missed and there will be greater errors when working on a digital project, for this reason, it is vital to have good communication in a team [3].  On top of these, a lack of testing can cause a project to fail. This could be caused by poor planning and time management If time management hasn’t been apt testing could be sacrificed. This may result in the software being released with errors and bugs in it. If this happens consumers may be sceptical about your product and are likely to go elsewhere. Loss of data could also impact a project causing it to fail. If a company loses the personal data of consumers. Or if the data needed to implement a digital project is lost a project could very easily fail. However, due to cloud network storage, this is unlikely. Human Error is always a risk on all types of projects. Through software and planning, we can limit the risk of human error impacting a project. For example, cloud servers limit the risk of someone losing the data for a project. </p>
            <p>
            The aforementioned risks can be limited with proper planning however there are some risks that can implement a digital project that cannot be avoided and are out of the direct control of the developer.
            olitical and global issues can affect your digital project for example if hardware necessary to complete your digital project becomes difficult to access you may have to cancel your project. An example of this is when the US imposed sanctions on China’s Huawei banning sales of chips made with American equipment to Huawei. And google stopped the phones being able to use their android OS in future models [4].  Changes in the market can cause a digital project to fail. If the time taken to implement a project has been too long or unfortunate there could no longer be a market for the project you are working on. This could also be the case if a competitor brings out a similar product before the completion of your project. Which would ultimately reduce the size of your target market. </p>

                1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?   
            </h3>
            <p> In order to select the right IT systems and software for a job. You need to be aware of the criteria of the job and have a clear idea of your objective. It is important that you know what you want the software to do. You cannot be successful in your search for the correct software unless you know what you are looking for [1]. In order to do this, we can analyze three main areas to help us chooses the right technology. These three areas being: What the software/ hardware must do. What problems the new solution must solve. The value of the solution. It can be important to quantify the strategic benefits of the new system [1]. On top of this, you are going to want the software to be efficient in completing the tasks that you need it for, whilst still being cost-effective. The level of support that is available should also be considered, if there is a large library of resources that can be accessed, implementing and using the software effectively could make all the difference to the project. </p>
            <p>
                Other things to take into account is the hardware you are using if you’re a freelance web designer working from home. It would be more valuable to have a laptop over a desktop. As the laptop would give you the possibility to go to meeting with clients outside of your home. With cloud storage now it means that if you have both and seamlessly work on the same projects on both using your laptop or even phone whilst you are away from your desktop. </p>

            <p>
                The technologies that I chose were a huge help in achieving the outcome of my projects. Trello enabled me to plan and organize my work providing me with the tools to keep on top of tasks and my ideas and make sure that I was on track to complete the project on time. Visual studio code provided me with the software to code my webpages efficiently and effectively.  Git makes it possible to track the changes in the files that are being worked on. Meaning that if any major changes were made that broke the website. It is easy to go back to a version before this happened. Git Hub provided me with the resources to publish my website. It meant that I was able to easily display my website and share it as I worked on it.

            <h3>
                1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
            </h3>

            <p>
                On May 25, 2018, the new European privacy regulation came into effect taking on the acronym GDPR. General Data Protection Regulation. The GDPR is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area. It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas [1]. It’s the EU’s way to give individuals more rights over there data and take power away from organizations using personal data for monetary gain [2]. </p>
            <p> Under the GDPR, individuals have:
            <ul>
            <li>The right to access.</li>
            <li>The right to be forgotten.</li>
            <li>The right to data portability.</li>
            <li>The right to be informed. </li> 
            <li>The right to have the information corrected. </li>
            <li>The right to restrict processing.</li> 
            <li>The right to object.</li>
            <li>The right to be notified.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the implementation of the GDPR when it comes to digital projects, we have to be more thoughtful about what we are developing. Making sure that we are more transparent about how data is collected and used. It is important to be more considerate of the user. And also, necessary to be more thorough in your development and documentation. [3]

               <p>
               When creating my website, I used numerous IT tools.  Visual studio code has been valuable tool in the creation of building my website. The text editor has enabled me to code and organise the HTML and CSS pages.  The side file bar on visual studio made it easy to view and access all the files being worked on. The function to split the screen in visual studio code also enabled me to view the HTML and CSS for a page side by side. The extensions that can be added to the visual studio code has made it easier to code quicker and more productively as well. I used the live server extension and this enabled me to view changes that I am making on my website as I go. Trello has been a very efficient way of planning tasks it enabled me to use the Kanban method that need to be done on the website. It has enabled me to see what I need to work on throughout the day to get closer to completion of my website. I have added a review section to the Trello board. This is so that I make sure I go through and test each section before completion.

               <p>
               The IT tools selected were appropriate. Visual studio code has had a lot of thought and time to perfect the interface and make it an efficient tool when coding. The auto complete feature means that you can code more quickly and it stores your different class and variables for you so that you can type out your code a lot quicker. This means that you can spend more time focusing on the functionality of your code. Through visual studio code I was easily able to work on all the files for my project enabling me to make the website in one program. Trello was appropriate as it enabled me to get any ideas that I had down as tasks to be done and then work through them, without the risk of missing any out or forgetting the idea. It also enabled me to prioritize the urgency of different tasks, this meant that could make sure I got all the essential parts of the development done and keep on track to finishing the project before the deadline.

               </h3>
               <p>
               My final project enabled me to put in to practice what I had learnt so far on this course.  I believe that the strength of my website are the functionality and the design. I went for a very simple clean design in order to make the website easy to read and navigate. All the navigation works and it contains all the information needed. A weakness would be the unresponsiveness of the website as it only displays correctly at one ratio. Another weakness would be that it doesn’t show much personality, due to going for a clean simple design feel, has restrict personality in the design. Changes that I would make to the website would be to work on the aforementioned. I would also like to use a different font as the font used was not 100% what I wanted it to be.

               <p>
               There are multiple improvements that I would make to my website. I would like to make it as accessible as possible. Having it so that it was responsive to all screen sizes in order to make it viewable on all devices. I would also like to give the website a contact box that emailed to my email so that people had the option to contact me through the website. I would also of like to clean up more code for readability by other developers if I had more time. And involve java script.

                The requirements where to create structures and styles for a web page.  Use website software and tools to prepare content for the site.  And too publish the site. I matched all the requirements with my final site and the website is fit for purpose. I created the structure of the website using HTML and styled it with CSS this was done using visual studio code software. All of the unit questions where completed and published on the website.  The website has also been published using Git Hub. I was able to show all that I have learned through the project. Resulting in a website that is fit for purpose meeting all of the requirements. </p>

                </h3>
                <p>
                The IT tools and systems used provided a lot of benefits to the productivity and efficiency of the project. Visual studio code is designed with the intension of providing a text editor that can boost productivity through the design, functionality and extensions. Trello enabled me to be more productive as well as it meant I was able to store ideas out of my head and organise the tasks needed to complete my project. This provided me with the ability to focus on the task I was currently undertaking on my project without having to constantly think of what else needed to be done, as they were already on the Trello board so I dint have to worry about forgetting them. </p>
                <p>
                If working in a team we could have all worked on different parts of the project. We would have had to spend more time planning the project deciding roles and honing down the design so that everyone knew what the end result needed to be like. As well as this we would have had to be clear on and decided on different classes and ID’s to use through the code so that the CSS and html matched up code.  We may have had some issue with there being slight variations on the design of each page if different people where working on the CSS  If we were working in a team, we would have had the benefits of using each members different skills, strengths and input.

                <p>
                Productivity and efficiency could have been improved by honing in the final design before coding the website. Changes in design on my website meant that I had to go back and change parts that I had previously completed. I could have also been more productive and efficient if we were working as a team and had other people working on different parts. If I had set myself deadlines for different parts I could have had it done more efficiently and had made sure I had finished each part completely before moving on to the next. Other ways to be more productive would be to take regular breaks, in order to stop yourself getting overwhelmed. This also means that your more likely to concentrate when working on the work and aren’t tiering yourself out too much.

                <p>
                Next time I would spend more time making sure I have completely planned the website as thoroughly as possible.  Making sure that I had each section planned completely first. I would make sure that I had a finished idea for the design, colour scheme and a selection of fonts ready before starting the coding. I would also make sure all the content going on the website was completed first or if in a team have someone working on the content independently.  I could also improve productivity by having a dedicated work area that I went to work outside of my home.

                <p>
                I would test digital solutions by trialling my website. Testing it throughout designing it, to make sure that the design is functioning.  I would check all pages next to each other so that I can see that the font is uniform and design is continuous across the pages. After I believe it is done, I would have someone else trialling it seeing if all the links are working and that there are no spelling mistakes or errors in the code. I would also test the site to see if it functions across all web browsers. The terminal in google chrome can be a useful tool to see if there were any CSS properties in the code but not being implemented that don’t need to be in the code.  After this is all done, I would have multiple people trial the website to see if it is user friendly and intuitive to navigate.
